Don't worry about this project, there's nothing to see here ...

This is just a simple JTextArea inside a JScrollPane inside a
JFrame. I always want a little "scratchpad" where I can keep text
and code snippets while I'm programming, so I finally broke down
and created this.

I'm also using this project to get more comfortable using ProGuard,
in particular from within an Ant build script.


Compiling/Building
------------------

At the moment, use this script to compile and run the app:

    _buildRun.sh

Just ignore the SBT and _build.sbt_ file, at least for now.
